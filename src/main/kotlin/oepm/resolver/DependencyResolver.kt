/**
 * Resolves a manifest's dependencies transitively, reading each resolved
 * package's own openedge-project.json until the whole graph is flat.
 *
 * DirectSource deps are always keyed by their own bare name, never an
 * inherited registry prefix - inheriting one was tried and dropped: two
 * differently-routed parents depending on the same repoUrl/ref would then
 * get different keys for what's really one shared dependency, falsely
 * tripping checkNoNamespaceCollision. Bare keys dedupe them correctly via
 * the repoUrl/ref check below instead.
 *
 * Exactly one resolution per key across the graph - any incompatible
 * second requirement (version, repoUrl/ref, or a Registry/DirectSource
 * mix) is an error, not a silent pick. A circular dependency is too.
 *
 * A resolved package's real namespace is independent of the key it was
 * resolved under, so two keys can still collide on the same real
 * namespace and silently shadow each other on PROPATH - caught by
 * checkNoNamespaceCollision below once the whole graph is known.
