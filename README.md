# oepm - a package manager for Progress OpenEdge ABL

## What this is

An experiment in bringing dependency management, versioning, and modular
code distribution to OpenEdge ABL. See `docs/research/` for the
comparative analysis (npm, pip, Maven/Ivy, existing OpenEdge tooling)
this design is based on.

This repo is just the plugin. The demo/consumer app and the registries/
packages it depends on live in their own separate repos - see "Remote
registries" below.

## Status

The core loop works end to end, against real, remote, git-hosted
registries:

- **Multi-registry, prefix-routed resolution** - any number of registries,
  each with its own routing prefix (e.g. `ba.`, `cw.`).
- **Catalog-based registries** - a registry is a small git repo holding
  only reference files, no package content. Fetches through a
  bare-clone-plus-`git worktree` cache, so repeat fetches are local.
- **Multi-version registries** - a package's catalog folder can hold any
  number of version files; install picks the highest one satisfying the
  caret range.
- **Direct-source dependencies** - a package can depend on another by
  inline `{repoUrl, ref}`, no registry involved.
- **Transitive resolution** with version-conflict detection across the
  whole graph, and **PROPATH namespace-collision detection** (two
  packages sharing a real ABL namespace fail loudly instead of silently
  shadowing each other).
- **Integrity verification** - `oepm.lock` records a content hash per
  package; a tag force-moved to different content fails loudly.
- **`buildPath` test entries** - `type: "test"` is excluded from PROPATH
  by default, included with `oepm propath --tests`. Never leaks from a
  dependency into a consumer.
- **`oepm prune [--dry-run]`** - removes `oepm_packages/`/`buildPath`
  entries no longer part of the resolved graph.
- **`oepm uninstall <package>`** - removes a dependency and cleans up its
  `oepm_packages/`/`oepm.lock`/`buildPath` entries in one step.
- Backward compatible: no `registries {}` configured falls back to a
  plain local-directory registry.

See `docs/decisions/` for what's been decided and why. Still missing:
include-collision linting, and real Gradle/Ivy-based resolution - version
matching (`oepm/version/`) and graph resolution (`oepm/resolver/`) are
hand-written instead, a known deviation from ADR-0001 worth raising with
the team before treating as settled.

## Per-machine setup

1. **Clone this repo.**
2. **Wire up your ABL project** - from your project's own directory:
   ```
   /path/to/oepm-tool/oepm-init      # oepm-init.bat on Windows
   ```
   You only need the full path the *first* time. It prompts for
   registries, scaffolds/patches your project non-destructively (safe to
   re-run), and offers to install the global CLI (step 3) - once that's
   done, bare `oepm-init` works from anywhere, for this or any future
   project. See `HANDOVER.md` and `docs/spec/kotlin-gradle-files.md` for
   what it actually does.
3. **(Optional) Install the global CLI**, so `oepm install`/`uninstall`/
   `propath`/`prune`/`registry add` work from any project without a
   `./`/`.\` prefix - `oepm-init` offers to do this for you, or run it
   directly:
   ```
   cli/install.sh      # cli\install.ps1 on Windows
   ```
   One-time, idempotent. Open a new terminal afterward for `PATH` to
   apply. This is `cli/oepm`, **not** the per-project `oepm`/`oepm.bat` -
   the per-project one finds its target by its own file location (works
   with zero global setup, e.g. in CI); `cli/oepm` finds its target by
   walking up from your current directory, which is what makes it safe
   to put on `PATH`. Don't put a per-project copy on `PATH` instead - it
   would silently operate on wherever that file happens to live.

### Commands

```
oepm-init                              wire up a new/existing project (interactive)
oepm install                           resolve declared dependencies
oepm install <package>[:<versionSpec>] add + resolve a dependency in one step
oepm uninstall <package>               remove a dependency and clean up its files
oepm propath [--tests]                 print the generated PROPATH
oepm registry add [<prefix> <url>]     add a registry (interactive if omitted)
oepm prune [--dry-run]                 remove oepm_packages/ entries no longer declared
```

## Creating a registry

A registry is just a plain git repo, no server or tooling involved - one
reference file per package version, at
`packages/<name>/<version>.json`:
```json
{
  "repoUrl": "https://github.com/yourorg/calculator.git",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "ref": "v1.0.0"
}
```
Create the repo, add that file, commit, push. That's the whole registry.
Publishing a new version means adding another `<version>.json` file, not
replacing the old one (see "Multi-version registries" above). Then point
a consumer project at it - see below.

## Publishing a package

A package is its own git repo, tagged at each version:
```
your-package/
  openedge-project.json
  src/
    yourorg/
      yourpackage/
        YourClass.cls        (class yourorg.yourpackage.YourClass:)
```
```json
{
  "name": "your-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "package_name": "yourorg.yourpackage",
  "dependencies": {},
  "buildPath": [{ "type": "source", "path": "src" }]
}
```
The folder structure under `src/` must mirror the class namespace - an
ABL requirement, not an oepm one. Fold your org into `package_name`/the
namespace (e.g. `yourorg.yourpackage`, not bare `yourpackage`) so it
doesn't collide with someone else's package of the same name - oepm
doesn't enforce this itself, it only catches an actual collision at
resolve time (see "PROPATH namespace-collision detection" above). Tag
the repo (`git tag v1.0.0`) matching whatever `ref` a registry's
reference file points at.

## Remote registries

Two mergeable config sources - a prefix declared in both, or twice in
one, is a duplicate-prefix error.

**`oepm-registries.properties`** (project root, committed, CLI-mutable):
```
ba.prefix=ba.
ba.catalogUrl=https://github.com/erudys27/registry-ba.git
```
Add to it with `oepm registry add [<prefix> <url> [<name>]]` (interactive
if omitted).

**`registries {}`** in `build.gradle.kts` (hand-authored):
```kotlin
oepm {
    registries {
        create("ba") {
            prefix.set("ba.")
            catalogUrl.set("https://github.com/erudys27/registry-ba.git")
        }
    }
}
```

A dependency like `"ba.calculator": "^1.0.0"` routes to whichever
registry's prefix it starts with. See
[openedge-package-manager](https://github.com/erudys27/openedge-package-manager)
for a real, working example. If neither source has any entries,
`oepmInstall` falls back to a plain local-directory registry
(`registryRoot`).
