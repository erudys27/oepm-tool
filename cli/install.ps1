# One-time setup: puts this directory (cli/) on the current user's PATH
# so the global `oepm` command works from inside any oepm-managed
# project, without a .\oepm.bat prefix and without touching each project
# individually. Safe to re-run - does nothing if already set up. See
# README.md's "Per-machine setup" for why this is a *separate* script
# from the per-project oepm/oepm.bat, not the same thing installed
# differently.
#
# -Check: silently exits 0 if already set up, 1 otherwise - no prompts,
# no writes, no output. Lets a caller (oepm-init.bat) decide whether it's
# even worth asking, instead of always asking and reporting "already
# done" after the fact.
