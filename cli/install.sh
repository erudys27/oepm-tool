# One-time setup: puts this directory (cli/) on PATH so the global `oepm`
# command works from inside any oepm-managed project, without a
# ./oepm.bat prefix and without touching each project individually. Safe
# to re-run - does nothing if already set up. See README.md's
# "Per-machine setup" for why this is a *separate* script from the
# per-project oepm/oepm.bat, not the same thing installed differently.
#
# --check: silently exits 0 if already set up, 1 otherwise - no prompts,
# no writes, no output. Lets a caller (oepm-init) decide whether it's
# even worth asking, instead of always asking and reporting "already
# done" after the fact.
